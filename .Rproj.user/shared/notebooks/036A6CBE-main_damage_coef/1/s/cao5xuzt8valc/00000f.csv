Mixed-Effects Model (k = 417; tau^2 estimator: ML)

tau^2 (estimated amount of residual heterogeneity):     0.1099 (SE = 0.0080)
tau (square root of estimated tau^2 value):             0.3316
I^2 (residual heterogeneity / unaccounted variability): 99.54%
H^2 (unaccounted variability / sampling variability):   219.29
R^2 (amount of heterogeneity accounted for):            5.61%

Test for Residual Heterogeneity:
QE(df = 414) = 41096.3735, p-val < .0001

Test of Moderators (coefficients 2:3):
QM(df = 2) = 17.5026, p-val = 0.0002
