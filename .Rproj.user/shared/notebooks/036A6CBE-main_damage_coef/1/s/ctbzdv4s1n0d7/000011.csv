Mixed-Effects Model (k = 417; tau^2 estimator: ML)

tau^2 (estimated amount of residual heterogeneity):     0.1099 (SE = 0.0080)
tau (square root of estimated tau^2 value):             0.3316
I^2 (residual heterogeneity / unaccounted variability): 99.54%
H^2 (unaccounted variability / sampling variability):   219.29

Test for Residual Heterogeneity:
QE(df = 414) = 41096.3735, p-val < .0001

Test of Moderators (coefficients 1:3):
QM(df = 3) = 1258.6134, p-val < .0001
